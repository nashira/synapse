We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.

We may use your information for other Business Purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Services or Apps, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.</p>


<p class="text-left">3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>

<p class="text-left">We may process or share data based on the following legal basis:</p>
<p class="text-left">Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.</p>

<p class="text-left">Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</p>

<p class="text-left">Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</p>

<p class="text-left">Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>
<p class="text-left">More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

<p class="text-left">Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We may share your data with third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services or Apps, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services or Apps over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

<p class="text-left">Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

<p class="text-left">Third-Party Advertisers. We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Services or Apps. These companies may use information about your visits to our Website(s) and other websites that are contained in web cookies and other tracking technologies in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>


<p class="text-left">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p class="text-left">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>

<p class="text-left">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


<p class="text-left">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

<p class="text-left">We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services or Apps is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>



<p class="text-left">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

<p class="text-left">We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services or Apps, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services or Apps. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

<p class="text-left">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>



<p class="text-left">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

<p class="text-left">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>



<p class="text-left">9. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>

<p class="text-left">California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>

<p class="text-left">If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services or Apps, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services or Apps.

<p class="text-left">10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</p>

<p class="text-left">In Short:  Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>

<p class="text-left">We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
